        Model United Nations is an academic simulation of the United Nations where students play the role of delegates
        from different countries and attempt to solve real world issues with policies and perspectives of an assigned
        country.<br>
        For example, a student may be assigned the United Kingdom and will have to solve global topics such as nuclear
        non-proliferation or climate change from the policies and perspectives of the United Kingdom.<br>
